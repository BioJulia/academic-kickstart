Please take a moment to read the [Julia Community Standards](https://julialang.org/community/standards/).
We expect that your participation in any Julia related forum, online or offline,
respects these standards.

## Channels

### GitHub

We use GitHub for the development of BioJulia itself. GitHub is where you will
find our source code, tracked issues, and the pull-requests. The discussions
there should be on topic and technical. For support and user questions, please
use the [Forum](#Forum) or [Chat](#Chat) channels.

### Forum

The primary online discussion venue for Julia is the [Discourse forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/).

The forum is the correct place to:

- **Keep up to date** on important Julia announcements like language releases and JuliaCon.
- **Ask a question** about any aspect of using or developing Julia or its associated packages and tools. The Discourse forum is the best place to get a fast, high-quality answer to your Julia question.
- **Respond to others' questions**.
- **Announce a new package** or solicit feedback about something you have been developing.
- **Advertise** Julia-related jobs and community events.

[There is a specific category for Biology and BioJulia](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/bio)

### Chat

For casual conversation and quick questions, we have a series of [Gitter chat rooms](https://gitter.im/BioJulia/home).
It is a good place to start if you think you need help but aren't quite sure
what you should be asking or where to ask it.
